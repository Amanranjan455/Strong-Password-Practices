What makes a password strong?
- At least 12 characters long
- Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoids dictionary words or obvious patterns
- Not reused across multiple accounts

What are common password attacks?
- Brute-force attacks
- Dictionary attacks
- Phishing attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Keylogger-based attacks

Why is password length important?
- Longer passwords significantly increase the number of possible combinations
- Makes brute-force attacks impractical
- More length = better security, especially when combined with complexity

What is a dictionary attack?
- A hacking technique where attackers use a pre-arranged list of common words, phrases, and leaked passwords to guess passwords quickly
- Faster than brute-force as it targets likely options first

What is multi-factor authentication?
- A security system that requires more than just a password to log in
- Combines something you know (password) with something you have (phone, token) or something you are (fingerprint, face recognition)
- Even if the password is compromised, account access is still protected

How do password managers help?
- Generate strong, random passwords automatically
- Store all passwords securely in an encrypted vault
- Reduce the need to remember multiple complex passwords
- Helps avoid password reuse

What are passphrases?
- A sequence of random words or a sentence used as a password
- Example: "PurpleMonkey$Climbs!High"
- Easier to remember but highly secure due to increased length

What are common mistakes in password creation?
- Using personal information (birthdays, names)
- Reusing passwords across different platforms
- Using simple or predictable patterns (e.g., "123456", "password")
- Short passwords
- Failing to enable multi-factor authentication
